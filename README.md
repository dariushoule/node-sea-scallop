# Scallop

**Scallop is a Swiss Army Knife for unpacking, repacking, and script stomping (TODO) nodejs single executable applications (SEA)s.**

Use it for source code recovery, malware analysis, or SEA internals exploration.

## Installation

```bash
[TODO] pip install node-sea-scallop
```

## Modes of Operation

### Unpack

Unpack extracts:
1. 🤖 The main javascript bundle from the binary's embedded SEA blob
2. 💾 The main code cache (if it exists) from the binary's embedded SEA blob
3. 🖼️ The embedded assets (if they exist) from the binary's embedded SEA blob
4. 🥩 The raw SEA blob

```bash
scallop unpack <target_sea_binary>
    # Creates target_sea_binary_unpacked in the same directory as target_sea_binary
```

### Repack

Repack replaces the main javascript bundle (or snapshot) with a file of your choosing.

```bash
scallop repack <target_sea_binary> <replacement_js_file_or_snap>
    # Repacks the new content in-place.
```

*NB: If your SEA is code signed, repacking will make the signature invalid. You'll need to be able to resign the binary to make it valid. If your SEA is not codesigned, everything will work as expected.*
